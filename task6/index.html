          <h2>The City</h2>
          <p>With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city and is China's second largest city after Shanghai</p>
          <p>As someone said, “If Beijing is China’s traditional, responsible older brother, Shanghai is the fashionable, shopaholic Wall Street younger sister who works hard and plays even harder.” Fast, bright, cutting-edge, over-the-top: everything in Shanghai is taken to its extreme and beyond. As one of the world’s most important business centers, the city is always in a hurry and seems to have buried its soul under unbelievable concrete highways.</p>
          <p>But Shanghai may just be the one and only place that can make such opposite identities coexist.</p>
